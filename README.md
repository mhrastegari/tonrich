# TonrRich
Tonrich is focused on providing detailed information and insights into any TON wallet. 
Imagine you see a wallet public key within an auction, and you have no idea of how strong or weak is that wallet. Then you hover on the wallet address, and you see this popup appearing on that wallet suddenly:

You haven’t even left the fragment.com, it just appears while you are still on the website. This is how **TonRich browser plugin** works. With this plugin you can have an instant answer to these questions about a wallet:
 - **Balance:** How much money is in it
 - **Worth:** The Balance + The value of NFTs that this wallet owns
 - **Deposit Rate:** How much money is being deposited into this wallet monthly.
 - **Deposit in last month:** How much money is being deposited to this wallet within the last month?
 - **Spend Rate:** How much money is being spent from this wallet monthly.
 - **Spend in last month:** How much money is being spent from this wallet within the last month?
 - **Daily Turnover Diagram:** A GitHub activity diagram-like overview of this wallet’s activity. How much activity had this wallet on each day during the last 6 months.
All you need to do is to install the TonRich plugin on your Chrome or Edge, then you will have such an insight into wallets on all these websites: fragment.com, getgems.io, ton.diamonds, tonapi.io and tonscan.org. 
TonRich, a user-friendly **browser plugin** works seamlessly with sites mentioned above, whenever you hover over a wallet address on these sites, Tonrich will show users a comprehensive overview of the wallet's activity, balance, transactions, and more. They can also use the **Tonrich Telegram bot** easily to get this information too, just by sending the wallet address to the bot.
